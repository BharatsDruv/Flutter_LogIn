# friends_login

This repository contains code for a flutter based login page application/widget(since everything in flutter is a widget) written in dart.

Since flutter allows us to write a single codebase for native IOS and android applications, the .dart files in this repository can be compiled for both android and ios native code.

However, the contents of this repository can be downloaded and run directly with flutter SDK to get a login page android application.

This is how the login page looks like :
